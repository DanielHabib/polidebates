## Project Mission
Our mission is to create short, unbiased YouTube Shorts that present both sides of various political debates. My usual process involves researching from different news sources like Fox News and MSNBC to capture the spectrum of perspectives on each topic. I'm hoping this experiment will expedite this process

## How to Contribute
I welcome contributions that help us achieve our mission. You can help in several ways:

### Address Bias
If you believe that any video scripts are biased, we encourage you to raise an issue or submit a pull request with proposed changes.

### Improve Avatars
Help us improve our representation by suggesting or making changes to avatars.

### General Improvements
Any changes that you think will help us in creating unbiased, clear, and concise YouTube shorts are more than welcome.
